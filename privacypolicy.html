                            Data that is provided to Us is stored on secure servers. Payment information and other sensitive data will be encrypted to ensure its safety.
                            The transmission of data via the internet is never completely secure, and We cannot guarantee the security of data that is sent to Us electronically. Your transmission of data to Us is at Your own risk.
                            Where data that You have transmitted to Us is password protected, You are responsible for keeping the password confidential. You are exclusively responsible for any breaches of Your data that results from Your own disclosure of or failure to protect Your password.
                            Customer data outside the U.S. may be transferred to Our website servers and/or third-party processors or subcontractors that are located in the U.S. We use Squarespace, which actively participate(s) in the U.S. Privacy Shield framework. The E.U. has determined that companies participating in the U.S. Privacy Shield have adequate safeguards in place to protect customer data.
                            
                            <b><li>DATA RETENTION:</li></b>
                            We retain personal data as long as it is needed to to conduct Our legitimate business purposes or to comply with Our legal obligations, or until You ask Us to delete Your data. For example, We will retain certain personal information indefinitely for the purposes of maintaining Your account, unless and until You delete Your account. Data that We gather for a specific and particular purpose, such as assisting law enforcement or analyzing trends, will be kept for no longer than is necessary for that particular purpose. Data that is no longer needed by Us for any of the purposes listed above will be permanently deleted.
                            We will honor Your request to delete Your data, as described more fully below, unless We are required by law to retain access to the data. However, note that We cannot control the retention policies of third parties. If You wish to have any third parties, including those to whom We’ve transmitted Your data, delete that data, You will need to contact those third parties directly. You may request from Us a list of all third parties to whom We have transmitted Your data.
                            We may retain usage data (that is, data that is gathered by Our company or third-party analytics companies for the purpose of analyzing the use of Our website) as needed for internal analysis purposes. This type of data is usually retained for a shorter period of time than personal data, unless the data is necessary to improve the security or functionality of Our website or offerings, or We are legally obligated to retain the data for a longer period of time.
                            
                            <b><li>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION:</li></b>
                            We take all reasonable steps to protect Your personal data and keep Your information secure. We use recognized online secure payment systems and implement generally accepted standards of security to protect against personal data loss or misuse. However, no security measure is foolproof, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or misuse. We cannot guarantee complete security of any information You transmit to Us.
                            By consent to this Privacy Policy, You acknowledge that Your personal data may be available, via the internet, around the world. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of Your data by other parties.
                            We will notify You promptly of any known breach of Our security systems or Your data which might expose You to serious risk.

                            Transfer Your Data: You have the right to request that We gather and transfer Your data to another controller, in a commonly used and machine readable format, unless doing so would cause Us an undue burden.
                            Delete All Data: You have the right to request that We delete all data that We hold about You, and We must delete such data without undue delay.

When processing has been restricted, We will continue to store Your data but will not pass it on to third-party processors without Your consent, or as necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect Your rights or those of others or Our company.

                            The State of California has established its own unique regulations that apply to California residents.
                            As of its effective date of August 13, 2020 We are also compliant with the California Consumer Privacy Act Of 2018, Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 Et Seq. (CCPA).
                            Any California resident may request, free of charge, the personal information We have collected or stored about themselves or about a member of their household. For security purposes, We reserve the right to ask for verification of Your identity and proof of your California residency at the time of your request.
                            Any California resident has a right to request the personal data We have collected, or request deletion of the personal data We have collected, including but not limited to:
                            Any personally identifying information, such as a real name, alias(es), mailing or resident address, IP address, email address, account name, biometrics, or any other data that could uniquely identify a California resident; and
                            Commercial information, including products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, search history, interactions with Our website, or any other purchasing or browsing history of Our site and/or offer(s); and

                            We reserve the right to collect any of the above data on California residents and their households.
                            We do not plan on selling your data. Regardless, any California resident can email us at info@amandamdesigns.com to explicitly request to opt-out of any such sale of data.
                            California residents also have the option to request a full deletion of their account and any data We have collected and associated with them.
                            We agree to comply with any data request or deletion made pursuant to the CCPA in a reasonable timeframe, during normal business hours and excluding holidays or Our pre-scheduled time off.
